**The Personal AI Agent is now a fully-featured, production-ready intelligent assistant with triple framework architecture offering LangChain (default implementation), Smolagents (alternative implementation), and Agno (latest implementation) systems. All three systems feature comprehensive MCP tool integration with 13 integrated tools spanning memory management, file operations, web research, code intelligence, GitHub integration, and multi-source research synthesis. The triple architecture provides maximum flexibility with LangChain's ReAct agent (`run_agent.py`) as the primary system, HuggingFace Smolagents multi-agent framework (`run_smolagents.py`) as the alternative, and native Agno framework (`run_agno.py`) as the latest implementation with enhanced knowledge base capabilities. All systems share robust testing infrastructure, modular architecture with custom MCP bridge, and streamlined web interfaces with enhanced response formatting. Recent improvements include the major agno framework migration enabling native memory and knowledge integration, previous code simplification through logging pane removal (639 lines reduced), improved UI design with response section enhancements, and fixed text formatting issues for optimal user experience across all three implementations.** 🎉
