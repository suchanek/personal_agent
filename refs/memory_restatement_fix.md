# Memory Restatement Fix

## Problem Description

The personal agent system was storing memories literally without restatement. When users stored memories using commands like `!My dog Kirra is an Australian Shepherd`, the system stored them in their original first-person form rather than converting them to third-person statements like `{user_id} has a dog named Kirra who is an Australian Shepherd`.

This issue affected the knowledge graph construction and made it harder to properly represent relationships between entities in the system.

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the codebase, we identified that while the `restate_user_fact` method existed in both `AgnoPersonalAgent` and `AgentMemoryManager` classes, it was never being called during the memory storage process.

The memory storage flow was:

1. CLI interface calls `store_immediate_memory` in `memory_commands.py`
2. This calls `agent.store_user_memory` in `AgnoPersonalAgent`
3. `AgnoPersonalAgent.store_user_memory` delegates to `memory_manager.store_user_memory` in `AgentMemoryManager`
4. `AgentMemoryManager.store_user_memory` directly stored the content without restatement in both SQLite and LightRAG graph systems

The `restate_user_fact` method was properly implemented but simply wasn't being called at any point in this flow.

## Solution Implemented

We modified the `store_user_memory` method in `AgentMemoryManager` to:

1. Call `self.restate_user_fact(content)` to convert the content from first-person to third-person
2. Use the restated content when storing the memory in both SQLite and LightRAG graph systems

```python
# Added this line to convert first-person to third-person
restated_content = self.restate_user_fact(content)

# Use restated_content instead of content when storing in SQLite
local_result = self.agno_memory.memory_manager.add_memory(
    memory_text=restated_content,  # Changed from content
    db=self.agno_memory.db,
    user_id=self.user_id,
    topics=topics,
)

# Use restated_content instead of content when storing in LightRAG
graph_result = await self.store_graph_memory(
    restated_content,  # Changed from content
    local_result.topics, 
    local_result.memory_id
)
```

## Benefits

This fix ensures that all memories are properly restated before being stored, which provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Knowledge Graph Construction**: Third-person statements make it easier to build accurate knowledge graphs with proper entity relationships.

2. **Consistent Memory Format**: All memories are now stored in a consistent third-person format, making retrieval and processing more predictable.

3. **Better Entity Recognition**: The restatement process helps identify the user as a distinct entity in the knowledge graph, improving entity recognition and relationship mapping.

4. **Enhanced Memory Retrieval**: When retrieving memories, the system can now properly attribute facts to the user, making responses more natural.

## Example

Before:
- User input: `!My dog Kirra is an Australian Shepherd`
- Stored as: `My dog Kirra is an Australian Shepherd`

After:
- User input: `!My dog Kirra is an Australian Shepherd`
- Stored as: `{user_id} has a dog named Kirra who is an Australian Shepherd`

This change ensures that the personal agent can properly understand and represent the user's memories in its knowledge systems.
