# 6. LightRAG Timeout Fix

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Context:** Users were experiencing `httpx.ReadTimeout` errors during large document ingestion into the LightRAG service. This issue manifested as failed uploads and incomplete processing, severely impacting the reliability of the knowledge base. The default timeout settings were insufficient for handling the transfer and processing times of larger files.
*   **Decision:** To resolve the `httpx.ReadTimeout` errors, the timeout value in the `lightrag` service's `config.ini` was increased. This adjustment allows sufficient time for large documents to be fully ingested and processed without premature connection termination.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   **Positive:**
        *   Eliminates `httpx.ReadTimeout` errors during large document ingestion, significantly improving the reliability and stability of the LightRAG service.
        *   Ensures successful processing of larger knowledge base updates.
    *   **Negative:**
        *   Increased timeout values could potentially mask other underlying performance issues if the ingestion process is genuinely slow for reasons other than network latency or processing time.
        *   Longer timeouts might tie up resources for extended periods if a connection truly hangs, though this is mitigated by the nature of the fix addressing expected long operations.
