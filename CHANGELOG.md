## [0.4.1] - 2025-06-08 🧠 **AGNO MEMORY INTEGRATION BREAKTHROUGH**

### 🚀 MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Agno Framework with Full Memory Integration

- **AGNO FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION**: Successfully implemented Agno framework as third agent option alongside LangChain and SmolaAgents
- **MEMORY RETRIEVAL FIXED**: Resolved critical issue where agents weren't automatically using memory tools for personal queries
- **TOOL NAMING BUG DISCOVERED**: Found and fixed ReasoningTools concatenation bug that corrupted function names (e.g., `thinkquery_knowledge_base` instead of `query_knowledge_base`)
- **AUTOMATIC MEMORY SEARCH**: Agno agent now automatically queries knowledge base for personal information (name, preferences, etc.)
- **PROPER TOOL INTEGRATION**: Fixed tool compatibility issues between LangChain decorators and Agno framework
- **ENHANCED AGENT INSTRUCTIONS**: Added explicit memory usage instructions for personal queries with mandatory language

### Added

- **Agno Agent Implementation**: Complete `AgnoPersonalAgent` class with MCP and memory integration
- **Agno CLI Interface**: `personal-agent-agno-cli` command for interactive Agno agent sessions
- **Dual Memory Tools**: Both `query_knowledge_base` and `get_user_information` functions for comprehensive memory access
- **Memory-First Instructions**: Agent instructions that prioritize memory search for personal queries with "ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT" language
- **Tool Integration Framework**: Seamless integration of LangChain tools with Agno-compatible wrappers
- **Standalone Async Functions**: Proper async memory tools with explicit `__name__` attributes for Agno compatibility

### Fixed

- **Critical Tool Naming Bug**: Temporarily disabled ReasoningTools to prevent function name corruption that broke memory tool access
- **Memory Tool Auto-Usage**: Fixed agents not automatically using memory tools for personal information retrieval
- **Tool Compatibility**: Resolved LangChain `@tool` decorator incompatibility with Agno framework
- **Agent Instructions Priority**: Moved memory instructions to the top of instruction sequence for highest priority
- **Async Tool Handling**: Proper async function wrapping for memory tools in Agno environment
- **Weaviate Initialization Sequence**: Ensured proper `initialize_agno_system()` call before agent creation

### Key Technical Insights

- **ReasoningTools Interference**: ReasoningTools was prefixing "think" to function names, breaking tool discovery
- **Instruction Order Matters**: Memory instructions must be first in the agent's instruction sequence
- **Forceful Language Required**: Agent instructions need "MANDATORY" and "DO NOT REASON ABOUT WHETHER TO USE TOOLS" language
- **Initialization Sequence Critical**: Weaviate must be initialized before agent creation for memory tools to be available

### Verified Working

- ✅ **Name Retrieval**: Agent correctly retrieves "Eric" from memory when asked "what is my name?"
- ✅ **Personal Information**: Successfully accesses stored DOB (4/11/1960) and preferences (Python, Lisp, C)
- ✅ **Memory Storage**: Interaction storage working with proper async handling
- ✅ **MCP Integration**: 6 MCP servers successfully connected with Agno framework
- ✅ **CLI Functionality**: Interactive CLI with streaming responses and tool calls

  - Memory tools: `from ..utils import setup_logging`
  - Main modules: `from .utils.logging import setup_logging`
  - Test files: Updated import paths to match new structure
- **Code Quality Improvements**: Enhanced docstrings, type hints, and PEP 8 compliance
- **Git Workflow**: Proper commit and push to dev2 branch with comprehensive change tracking
- **Impact**: More robust system with centralized logging, automatic error recovery, and improved maintainability

#### ✅ Web Interface Fixes (May 2025)

- **Agent Info Page Fix**: Resolved 'not found' error when clicking Agent Info button
  - Fixed URL mismatch: Updated button URL from `/info` to `/agent_info` in web template
- **Tool Display Fix**: Resolved "'str' object has no attribute 'name'" error on agent info page
  - Root cause: smolagents tools stored as dictionary (keys=tool names, values=tool objects) instead of list
  - Solution: Changed tool name extraction from `[tool.name for tool in tools]` to `list(smolagents_agent.tools.keys())`
  - Added defensive handling for both dictionary and list tool formats
- **Impact**: Agent info page now displays correctly showing all 13 tools (filesystem.mcp_read_file, research.web_search, memory.store_interaction, etc.)
- **Status**: Web interface fully functional with both main chat page and agent info page working correctly

#### ✅ Smolagents Integration & Migration (Major Update)

- **Framework Migration**: Successfully migrated from LangChain ReAct to HuggingFace smolagents multi-agent framework
- **MCP Bridge**: Created custom integration layer (`smol_main.py`) connecting MCP servers to smolagents
- **Tool Registration**: Automatic discovery and registration of all 13 MCP tools as smolagents SimpleTool objects
- **Agent Architecture**: Implemented smolagents CodeAgent with Ollama LLM backend
- **Web Interface**: Updated Flask interface (`smol_interface.py`) for smolagents interaction
- **Tool Management**: Tools stored as dictionary format enabling efficient access and display
- **Impact**: More robust agent framework with better tool integration and multi-agent capabilities
- **Modular Architecture Migration**: Successfully refactored from monolithic `personal_agent.py` to organized `src/` structure
- **System Integration**: All 6 MCP servers and 13 tools working in refactored codebase
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Added 20+ test files with organized categories and test runner
- **GitHub Tool Integration**: Created comprehensive test suite (`test_github.py`) with 7 test functions
- **Authentication Fix**: Resolved GitHub Personal Access Token environment variable passing to MCP subprocess
- **MCP Client Enhancement**: Updated `SimpleMCPClient` to properly handle environment variables
- **Test Organization**: Moved all debug scripts to `tests/` directory with updated import paths
- **Tool Discovery**: Identified and documented 26 available GitHub MCP tools
- **100% Test Success**: All GitHub functionality tests now pass with proper authentication
- **Git Integration**: Proper commit workflow with comprehensive change tracking

**The Personal AI Agent is now a fully-featured, production-ready intelligent assistant with triple framework architecture offering LangChain (default implementation), Smolagents (alternative implementation), and Agno (latest implementation) systems. All three systems feature comprehensive MCP tool integration with 13 integrated tools spanning memory management, file operations, web research, code intelligence, GitHub integration, and multi-source research synthesis. The triple architecture provides maximum flexibility with LangChain's ReAct agent (`run_agent.py`) as the primary system, HuggingFace Smolagents multi-agent framework (`run_smolagents.py`) as the alternative, and native Agno framework (`run_agno.py`) as the latest implementation with enhanced knowledge base capabilities. All systems share robust testing infrastructure, modular architecture with custom MCP bridge, and streamlined web interfaces with enhanced response formatting. Recent improvements include the major agno framework migration enabling native memory and knowledge integration, previous code simplification through logging pane removal (639 lines reduced), improved UI design with response section enhancements, and fixed text formatting issues for optimal user experience across all three implementations.** 🎉
