# REST API Model Key Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-14  
**Branch:** v0.8.72dev  
**Issue:** REST API `/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/status` endpoints returning `"model": "unknown"`

---

## Problem Statement

The REST API endpoints were incorrectly attempting to retrieve the model information from global state, resulting in `"unknown"` being returned instead of the actual LLM model name (e.g., `hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-GGUF:q8_0`).

### Symptoms
- `/api/v1/health` endpoint: `"model": "unknown"`
- `/api/v1/status` endpoint: `"model": "unknown"`
- External systems and curl commands couldn't determine which model was in use

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue stemmed from a key naming mismatch between:
1. **Internal storage**: Global state stores model as `"llm_model"`
2. **External API**: `get_status()` method returns it as `"model"`

The REST API code was incorrectly trying to access `global_status.get("llm_model")` when it should have been accessing `global_status.get("model")`.

**Code Path:**
```python
# global_state.py line 66
def get_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        # ... other fields ...
        "model": self._state.get("llm_model", "unknown")  # Internal "llm_model" → External "model"
    }
```

---

## Solution

### Changes Made

**File:** `src/personal_agent/tools/rest_api.py`

#### 1. Health Check Endpoint (Line ~155)
**Before:**
```python
model = global_status.get("llm_model", "unknown")  # WRONG - get_status doesn't return this key
```

**After:**
```python
model = global_status.get("model", "unknown")  # CORRECT - matches get_status() return value
```

#### 2. Status Endpoint (Line ~210)
**Before:**
```python
# Complex 40+ line fallback logic trying various sources
if self.streamlit_session:
    model = self.streamlit_session.get("current_model", ...)
else:
    # Multiple try/except blocks...
    model = "hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-GGUF:q8_0"
```

**After:**
```python
# Simple, direct access to global state
user = global_status.get("user", "unknown")
model = global_status.get("model", "unknown")  # CORRECT - 2 lines instead of 40+
```

### Code Impact
- **Lines Changed:** 2 critical lines
- **Lines Removed:** ~40 lines of unnecessary fallback logic
- **Complexity Reduction:** Eliminated session state fallback logic
- **Consistency:** Both endpoints now use identical pattern

---

## Testing & Verification

### Test Environment
- **Streamlit App:** Running on `http://localhost:8001`
- **REST API Server:** Embedded in Streamlit process
- **User:** charlie
- **Model:** `hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-GGUF:q8_0`

### Test Script Created
Created `test_rest_api_model.py` to validate:
1. `/api/v1/health` endpoint returns correct model
2. `/api/v1/status` endpoint returns correct model
3. Global state inspection shows proper key mapping

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Quick health check
curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A 1 '"model"'

# Full status check
curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/v1/status | python3 -m json.tool

# Comprehensive test
source .venv/bin/activate && python test_rest_api_model.py
```

### Test Results
✅ **PASS:** Model correctly returns `hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-GGUF:q8_0`  
✅ **PASS:** User correctly returns `charlie`  
✅ **PASS:** Both endpoints consistent  
✅ **PASS:** External curl access works  
✅ **PASS:** Remote shortcut access works

## Architecture Insights

### Global State Key Mapping
The global state system uses a **two-tier key structure**:

| Internal Storage | External API | Purpose |
|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| `llm_model` | `model` | LLM model identifier |
| `userid` | `user` | Current user ID |
| `agent_mode` | `agent_mode` | Single/Team mode |
| `agent` | `agent_available` | Agent existence (boolean) |
| `team` | `team_available` | Team existence (boolean) |
| `memory_helper` | `memory_helper_available` | Memory system status |
| `knowledge_helper` | `knowledge_helper_available` | Knowledge system status |

### Data Flow
```
Streamlit Session State
        ↓
   session_state.get("current_model")
        ↓
update_global_state_from_streamlit()
        ↓
   global_state.set("llm_model", ...)  [Internal storage]
        ↓
   global_state.get_status()
        ↓
   {"model": ..., "user": ...}  [External API]
        ↓
   REST API Endpoints
```

### Process Isolation Note
Global state is **process-specific** and not shared between:
- Streamlit app process (where REST API runs)
- Test scripts run separately
- CLI commands run in different processes

This explains why setting global state in a separate Python script didn't affect the running Streamlit/REST API process.

## Benefits

### 1. Simplified Code
- **Removed:** 40+ lines of complex fallback logic
- **Added:** 2 lines of direct access
- **Maintenance:** Much easier to understand and maintain

### 2. Consistency
- Both endpoints use identical approach
- Matches global state architecture patterns
- Follows existing codebase conventions

### 3. Reliability
- Direct access to source of truth (global state)
- No dependency on session state availability
- Predictable behavior

### 4. External Integration
- Remote systems can now correctly identify active model
- Health checks return accurate information
- Monitoring systems can track model usage

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Check API Contracts
The `get_status()` method documentation and return type should have been checked first. The internal storage key doesn't necessarily match the external API key.

### 2. Simplicity Over Complexity
The original 40+ line fallback logic was trying to solve a problem that didn't exist. Direct access to global state was always the correct solution.

### 3. Test in Same Process
When testing global state, tests must run in the same process as the application. Separate test scripts won't share the same memory space.

### 4. Page Refresh Required
When Streamlit session state changes, the global state update function (`update_global_state_from_streamlit`) must be triggered by a page refresh or navigation event.

## Future Considerations

### 1. Type Safety
Consider adding TypedDict or Pydantic models for `get_status()` return type to catch these issues at development time.

### 2. Documentation
Update `global_state.py` docstrings to clearly document:
- Internal storage keys vs. external API keys
- Key mapping table
- Expected behavior

### 3. Testing
Add integration tests that verify REST API endpoints return correct model information from a running Streamlit instance.

### 4. Monitoring
Consider logging model changes when global state is updated to help debug similar issues in the future.

## Conclusion

This fix resolves a critical issue where external systems couldn't determine which LLM model was in use. The solution was straightforward once the key naming mismatch was identified: use `"model"` (external API key) instead of `"llm_model"` (internal storage key) when reading from `get_status()`.

The fix:
- ✅ Simplifies code (40+ lines → 2 lines)
- ✅ Improves reliability
- ✅ Enables proper external monitoring
- ✅ Follows existing architecture patterns

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Tested and verified working with curl and remote access.
