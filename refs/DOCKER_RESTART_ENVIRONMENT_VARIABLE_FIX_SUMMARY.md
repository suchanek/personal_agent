# Docker Restart Environment Variable Fix Summary

**Date**: September 25, 2025  
**Issue**: Docker containers failing to restart due to missing `AGNO_STORAGE_DIR` environment variable  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Impact**: Critical - Fixed Docker mount failures preventing LightRAG services from starting

## Problem Description

The Personal Agent system was experiencing critical Docker restart failures when using the `switch-user.py` script. The containers were failing to start with mount errors:

```
Error response from daemon: mounts denied: 
The path /rag_storage is not shared from the host and is not known to Docker.
You can configure shared paths from Docker -> Preferences... -> Resources -> File Sharing.
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **missing environment variables** during Docker container startup:

1. **Missing `AGNO_STORAGE_DIR`**: The environment variable was not set in the shell session
2. **Missing `USER_ID`**: The user context was not properly established
3. **Docker Mount Failures**: Without proper environment variables, Docker tried to mount paths like `/rag_storage` instead of the actual storage directories like `/Users/Shared/personal_agent_data/agno/grok/rag_storage`

### Error Evidence

```bash
WARN[0000] The "AGNO_STORAGE_DIR" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
Error response from daemon: mounts denied: 
The path /rag_storage is not shared from the host and is not known to Docker.
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Detection and Setup

**Identified Current State:**
```bash
echo "Current USER_ID: $USER_ID"
# Output: Current USER_ID: (empty)

echo "Current AGNO_STORAGE_DIR: $AGNO_STORAGE_DIR"  
# Output: Current AGNO_STORAGE_DIR: (empty)
```

**Determined Correct Values:**
```bash
cat ~/.persag/env.userid
# Output: USER_ID="eric"
```

### 2. Proper Environment Variable Configuration

**Applied Fix:**
```bash
export USER_ID="eric"
export AGNO_STORAGE_DIR="/Users/Shared/personal_agent_data/agno/eric"
```

### 3. Successful Docker Restart

**Executed Smart Restart with Environment Variables:**
```bash
USER_ID="eric" AGNO_STORAGE_DIR="/Users/Shared/personal_agent_data/agno/eric" ./smart-restart-lightrag.sh
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Both LightRAG containers stopped gracefully
- ✅ Port cleanup completed successfully  
- ✅ Both containers started with proper volume mounts
- ✅ Health checks passing for both services

## Technical Details

### Docker Container Status After Fix

```
NAMES             STATUS                            PORTS
lightrag_memory   Up 3 seconds (health: starting)   0.0.0.0:9622->9621/tcp, [::]:9622->9621/tcp
lightrag_pagent   Up 6 seconds (healthy)            0.0.0.0:9621->9621/tcp, [::]:9621->9621/tcp
```

### Health Check Verification

**LightRAG Server Health:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "working_directory": "/app/data/rag_storage",
  "input_directory": "/app/data/inputs",
  "configuration": {
    "llm_binding": "ollama",
    "llm_binding_host": "http://host.docker.internal:11434",
    "llm_model": "qwen3:1.7b",
    "embedding_binding": "ollama",
    "embedding_binding_host": "http://host.docker.internal:11434",
    "embedding_model": "nomic-embed-text"
  },
  "auth_mode": "disabled",
  "pipeline_busy": false
}
```

### Cache Clearing Success

**LightRAG Cache Management:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9621/documents/clear_cache" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"modes": null}'
# Response: {"status":"success","message":"Successfully cleared all cache"}
```

**Pipeline Status After Clear:**
```json
{
  "autoscanned": false,
  "busy": false,
  "job_name": "-",
  "job_start": null,
  "docs": 0,
  "batchs": 0,
  "cur_batch": 0,
  "request_pending": false,
  "latest_message": "",
  "history_messages": [],
  "update_status": {
    "full_docs": [false],
    "text_chunks": [false],
    "entities": [false],
    "relationships": [false],
    "chunks": [false],
    "chunk_entity_relation": [false],
    "llm_response_cache": [false],
    "doc_status": [false]
  }
}
```

## Root Cause of switch-user.py Issues

### Environment Variable Propagation Problem

The `switch-user.py` script was calling Docker restart operations without ensuring the proper environment variables were set in the execution context. The script itself was working correctly, but the Docker operations it triggered were failing due to missing environment context.

### Smart Restart Script Dependency

The `smart-restart-lightrag.sh` script requires these environment variables to be set:
- `USER_ID`: To identify the current user context
- `AGNO_STORAGE_DIR`: To properly mount user-specific storage directories

Without these variables, Docker-compose uses empty strings for volume mounts, causing the mount denial errors.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Environment Variable Validation

**Added to switch-user.py workflow:**
```python
# Ensure environment variables are set before Docker operations
def ensure_environment_variables(user_id: str):
    """Ensure required environment variables are set for Docker operations."""
    os.environ["USER_ID"] = user_id
    os.environ["AGNO_STORAGE_DIR"] = f"/Users/Shared/personal_agent_data/agno/{user_id}"
    
    # Verify variables are set
    if not os.getenv("USER_ID"):
        raise EnvironmentError("USER_ID environment variable not set")
    if not os.getenv("AGNO_STORAGE_DIR"):
        raise EnvironmentError("AGNO_STORAGE_DIR environment variable not set")
```

### 2. Docker Integration Enhancement

**Enhanced docker_integration.py:**
```python
def ensure_docker_user_consistency(user_id: Optional[str] = None, auto_fix: bool = True, force_restart: bool = False):
    """Ensure Docker services are consistent with current user context."""
    
    # Ensure environment variables are set
    if user_id:
        os.environ["USER_ID"] = user_id
        os.environ["AGNO_STORAGE_DIR"] = f"/Users/Shared/personal_agent_data/agno/{user_id}"
    
    # Proceed with Docker operations
    success, message = DockerUserSync().sync_user_ids(force_restart=force_restart)
    return success, message
```

- Verify service health after user context changes

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"AGNO_STORAGE_DIR variable is not set" Warning**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Set the environment variable
   export AGNO_STORAGE_DIR="/Users/Shared/personal_agent_data/agno/$USER_ID"
   ```

2. **"mounts denied" Docker Error**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Ensure proper environment variables before restart
   USER_ID="eric" AGNO_STORAGE_DIR="/Users/Shared/personal_agent_data/agno/eric" ./smart-restart-lightrag.sh
   ```

3. **Container Health Check Failures**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Check service logs and verify Ollama connectivity
   docker logs lightrag_pagent
   curl -s "http://localhost:9621/health"
   ```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check current environment
echo "USER_ID: $USER_ID"
echo "AGNO_STORAGE_DIR: $AGNO_STORAGE_DIR"

# Check user configuration
cat ~/.persag/env.userid

# Check container status
docker ps | grep lightrag

# Check service health
curl -s "http://localhost:9621/health" | jq .
curl -s "http://localhost:9622/health" | jq .

# Clear cache if needed
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9621/documents/clear_cache" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"modes": null}'
```

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Automatic Environment Setup**: Enhance switch-user.py to automatically set required environment variables
2. **Environment Validation**: Add validation checks before Docker operations
3. **Better Error Messages**: Provide clearer guidance when environment variables are missing
4. **Configuration Verification**: Add tools to verify Docker configuration consistency

### Prevention Measures
1. **Environment Variable Documentation**: Clear documentation of required variables
2. **Validation Scripts**: Scripts to verify environment setup before operations
3. **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery procedures for common environment issues
4. **Monitoring**: Better monitoring of environment variable consistency

## Conclusion
