# Memory and Knowledge Tools Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive refactoring of the unified `MemoryAndKnowledgeTools` class into two separate, focused toolkits: `KnowledgeTools` and `AgnoMemoryTools`. The refactoring improves separation of concerns, enhances agent guidance through descriptive docstrings, and provides clearer architectural boundaries between knowledge and memory operations.

## Motivation

The original `MemoryAndKnowledgeTools` class combined two distinct types of operations:
- **Knowledge Operations**: Managing factual information, documents, and reference materials
- **Memory Operations**: Storing and retrieving personal information about the user

This unified approach led to:
- Unclear boundaries between different types of information
- Difficulty in maintaining and extending individual components
- Potential confusion for the agent about when to use which functionality

## Changes Made

### 1. New File Structure

#### Created Files:
- **`src/personal_agent/tools/knowledge_tools.py`** - Contains the `KnowledgeTools` class
- **`src/personal_agent/tools/refactored_memory_tools.py`** - Contains the `AgnoMemoryTools` class
- **`refs/MEMORY_KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`** - This documentation

#### Modified Files:
- **`src/personal_agent/core/agno_agent.py`** - Updated to use separate tool classes
- **`src/personal_agent/core/agent_instruction_manager.py`** - Updated tool descriptions

#### Preserved Files:
- **`src/personal_agent/tools/memory_and_knowledge_tools.py`** - Original file kept for backward compatibility

### 2. KnowledgeTools Class

#### Purpose
Manages factual information, documents, and reference materials that don't change over time.

#### Key Features:
- **File Ingestion**: `ingest_knowledge_file()`, `ingest_knowledge_text()`, `ingest_knowledge_from_url()`
- **Batch Processing**: `batch_ingest_directory()`
- **Knowledge Querying**: `query_knowledge_base()`
- **LightRAG Integration**: `_upload_to_lightrag()`

#### Enhanced Docstring:
```python
"""Knowledge Base Management Tools - For storing and retrieving factual information, documents, and reference materials.

Use these tools when you need to:
- Store factual information, documents, or reference materials for future retrieval
- Search for previously stored knowledge, facts, or documents
- Ingest content from files, URLs, or text into the knowledge base
- Find information that was previously added to the knowledge base

DO NOT use these tools for:
- Storing personal information about the user (use memory tools instead)
- Creative requests like writing stories or poems
- General questions that don't require stored knowledge

The knowledge base is separate from memory - it's for factual information that doesn't change,
while memory is for personal information about the user that evolves over time.
"""
```

#### Toolkit Instructions:
```python
instructions="""Use these tools to manage factual information and documents in the knowledge base. 
Store reference materials, facts, and documents that don't change. 
Query when you need to find previously stored factual information.
Do NOT use for personal user information - use memory tools for that."""
```

### 3. AgnoMemoryTools Class

#### Purpose
Manages personal information about the user, including preferences, interests, and personal facts.

#### Key Features:
- **Memory Storage**: `store_user_memory()`, `store_graph_memory()`
- **Memory Retrieval**: `query_memory()`, `get_all_memories()`, `get_recent_memories()`, `list_memories()`
- **Memory Management**: `update_memory()`, `delete_memory()`, `clear_memories()`
- **Graph Operations**: `query_graph_memory()`, `get_memory_graph_labels()`
- **Topic Management**: `get_memories_by_topic()`, `delete_memories_by_topic()`

#### Enhanced Docstring:
```python
"""Personal Memory Management Tools - For storing and retrieving information ABOUT THE USER.

Use these tools when you need to:
- Store personal information the user tells you about themselves
- Remember user preferences, interests, hobbies, and personal facts
- Retrieve what you know about the user when they ask
- Update or manage existing memories about the user
- Store information the user explicitly asks you to remember

CRITICAL RULES for what to store:
- Store facts ABOUT the user (their preferences, experiences, personal info)
- Store when user says "remember that..." or gives explicit personal information
- Convert first-person statements to third-person for storage ("I like skiing" → "User likes skiing")

DO NOT store:
- Your own actions or tasks you perform FOR the user
- Conversational filler or acknowledgments
- Questions the user asks (unless they reveal personal info)
- Creative content you generate

When presenting memories, always convert back to second person ("User likes skiing" → "you like skiing").
These tools help you build a personal relationship by remembering what matters to the user.
"""
```

#### Toolkit Instructions:
```python
instructions="""Use these tools to remember personal information ABOUT THE USER. 
Store user preferences, interests, and personal facts they share with you.
Always check memory when asked about the user. Present memories in second person.
Do NOT store your own actions - only store facts about the user themselves."""
```

### 4. Integration Updates

#### AgnoPersonalAgent Changes (`src/personal_agent/core/agno_agent.py`):

**Import Updates:**
```python
# Before
from ..tools.memory_and_knowledge_tools import MemoryAndKnowledgeTools

# After
from ..tools.knowledge_tools import KnowledgeTools
from ..tools.refactored_memory_tools import AgnoMemoryTools
```

**Initialization Changes:**
```python
# Before
self.memory_and_knowledge_tools = MemoryAndKnowledgeTools(
    self.memory_manager, self.knowledge_manager
)

# After
# Initialize separate tool classes
self.knowledge_tools = None
self.memory_tools = None
```

**Tool Addition Changes:**
```python
# Before
if self.enable_memory:
    tools.append(self.memory_and_knowledge_tools)
    logger.info("Added MemoryAndKnowledgeTools to agent")

# After
if self.enable_memory:
    # Create and add separate knowledge and memory tools
    self.knowledge_tools = KnowledgeTools(self.knowledge_manager)
    self.memory_tools = AgnoMemoryTools(self.memory_manager)
    
    tools.append(self.knowledge_tools)
    tools.append(self.memory_tools)
    logger.info("Added separate KnowledgeTools and AgnoMemoryTools to agent")
```

#### Agent Instruction Manager Changes (`src/personal_agent/core/agent_instruction_manager.py`):

**Tool List Updates:**
```python
# Before
"- **MemoryAndKnowledgeTools**: Unified memory & knowledge system with functions:",
"  - Memory: `store_user_memory`, `query_memory`, `get_all_memories`, `get_recent_memories`, `list_memories`, `get_memories_by_topic`, `query_graph_memory`, `update_memory`, `store_graph_memory`",
"  - Knowledge: `query_knowledge_base`, `ingest_knowledge_text`, `ingest_knowledge_file`, `ingest_knowledge_from_url`, `batch_ingest_directory`",

# After

## Technical Implementation Details

### Class Structure

#### KnowledgeTools
```python
class KnowledgeTools(Toolkit):
    def __init__(self, knowledge_manager: KnowledgeManager)
    
    # Core Methods:
    def ingest_knowledge_file(self, file_path: str, title: str = None) -> str
    def ingest_knowledge_text(self, content: str, title: str, file_type: str = "txt") -> str
    def ingest_knowledge_from_url(self, url: str, title: str = None) -> str
    def batch_ingest_directory(self, directory_path: str, file_pattern: str = "*", recursive: bool = False) -> str
    def query_knowledge_base(self, query: str, mode: str = "auto", limit: Optional[int] = 5) -> str
    
    # Helper Methods:
    def _upload_to_lightrag(self, file_path: Path, filename: str) -> str
```

#### AgnoMemoryTools
```python
class AgnoMemoryTools(Toolkit):
    def __init__(self, memory_manager: SemanticMemoryManager)
    
    # Core Methods:
    async def store_user_memory(self, content: str = "", topics: Union[List[str], str, None] = None) -> str
    async def query_memory(self, query: str, limit: Union[int, None] = None) -> str
    async def update_memory(self, memory_id: str, content: str, topics: Union[List[str], str, None] = None) -> str
    async def delete_memory(self, memory_id: str) -> str
    async def get_recent_memories(self, limit: int = 10) -> str
    async def get_all_memories(self) -> str
    async def get_memory_stats(self) -> str
    async def get_memories_by_topic(self, topics: Union[List[str], str, None] = None, limit: Union[int, None] = None) -> str
    async def list_memories(self) -> str
    async def store_graph_memory(self, content: str, topics: Union[List[str], str, None] = None, memory_id: str = None) -> str
    async def query_graph_memory(self, query: str, mode: str = "mix", top_k: int = 5, response_type: str = "Multiple Paragraphs") -> dict
    async def get_memory_graph_labels(self) -> str
    async def clear_memories(self) -> str
    async def delete_memories_by_topic(self, topics: Union[List[str], str]) -> str
    async def clear_all_memories(self) -> str
```

### Integration Pattern

The refactored tools integrate seamlessly with the existing Agno framework:

1. **Toolkit Inheritance**: Both classes inherit from `agno.tools.Toolkit`
2. **Manager Injection**: Each toolkit receives its respective manager (KnowledgeManager or SemanticMemoryManager)
3. **Tool Registration**: Tools are automatically registered with the Agno agent
4. **Async Support**: Memory tools support async operations for better performance

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code

If you have existing code that uses `MemoryAndKnowledgeTools`, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Continue Using the Original (Backward Compatibility)
```python
from ..tools.memory_and_knowledge_tools import MemoryAndKnowledgeTools
# No changes needed - original class still available
```

#### Option 2: Migrate to Separate Tools (Recommended)
```python
from ..tools.knowledge_tools import KnowledgeTools
from ..tools.refactored_memory_tools import AgnoMemoryTools

# Create separate instances
knowledge_tools = KnowledgeTools(knowledge_manager)
memory_tools = AgnoMemoryTools(memory_manager)

# Add both to agent
tools.extend([knowledge_tools, memory_tools])
```

### For New Development

Use the separate tools for better architecture:

```python
# For factual information and documents
knowledge_tools = KnowledgeTools(knowledge_manager)

# For personal user information
memory_tools = AgnoMemoryTools(memory_manager)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Enhanced Tool Discovery**: Add metadata to help agents better understand tool capabilities
2. **Cross-Tool Integration**: Develop patterns for coordinating between knowledge and memory operations
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize tool selection and execution for better performance
4. **Extended Documentation**: Add more detailed examples and use cases

### Extensibility

The refactored architecture makes it easier to:
- Add new knowledge sources and formats
- Extend memory capabilities with new storage patterns
- Integrate with additional external services
- Implement specialized tool variants for specific use cases

## Conclusion

This refactoring successfully separates knowledge and memory operations into focused, well-documented toolkits. The enhanced docstrings provide clear guidance for agent decision-making, while the improved architecture supports better maintainability and extensibility. The changes maintain backward compatibility while providing a cleaner foundation for future development.

The refactoring demonstrates best practices for:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each toolkit has a single, focused responsibility
- **Agent Guidance**: Descriptive documentation helps AI agents make better decisions
- **Architectural Clarity**: Clear boundaries between different types of operations
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand, modify, and extend individual components
