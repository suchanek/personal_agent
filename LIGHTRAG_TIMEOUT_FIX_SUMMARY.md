# LightRAG Server Timeout Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

The LightRAG server was experiencing `httpx.ReadTimeout` errors when processing PDF documents, specifically during communication with the Ollama server. The errors occurred because:

1. **Inadequate Model Performance**: Using `qwen3:1.7b` (1.7B parameters) - too small for complex PDF processing
2. **Insufficient Timeout Configuration**: Default httpx client timeouts were too short for large document processing
3. **Suboptimal Processing Settings**: Large chunk sizes causing memory and processing bottlenecks

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Model Upgrade
- **Before**: `qwen3:1.7b` (1.7B parameters)
- **After**: `qwen2.5:latest` (7B parameters)
- **Benefit**: Significantly better performance for document processing and text understanding

### 2. Timeout Configuration Enhancements

#### Environment Variables (`lightrag_server/env.server`)
```bash
# Extended timeout settings
LLM_TIMEOUT=7200          # 2 hours for LLM processing
EMBEDDING_TIMEOUT=3600    # 1 hour for embedding processing
HTTPX_TIMEOUT=7200        # 2 hours for httpx client operations
HTTPX_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=600 # 10 minutes for connection timeout
HTTPX_READ_TIMEOUT=7200   # 2 hours for read operations
HTTPX_WRITE_TIMEOUT=600   # 10 minutes for write operations
HTTPX_POOL_TIMEOUT=600    # 10 minutes for connection pool timeout

# Ollama-specific settings
OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=7200       # 2 hours for Ollama operations
OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=3600    # Keep model loaded for 1 hour
OLLAMA_NUM_PREDICT=16384  # Maximum tokens to generate
OLLAMA_TEMPERATURE=0.1    # Lower temperature for consistent processing
```

#### Configuration File (`lightrag_server/config.ini`)
```ini
[server]
request_timeout = 7200
keepalive_timeout = 600

[llm]
timeout = 7200
temperature = 0.1
keep_alive = 3600
num_predict = 16384

[processing]
pdf_chunk_size = 1024      # Reduced from 10000
max_retries = 5            # Increased from 3
retry_delay = 60           # Increased from 30
batch_size = 1
enable_chunking = true
chunk_overlap = 100
max_concurrent_requests = 1
backoff_factor = 2.0
```

### 3. Docker Configuration Updates

#### Docker Compose (`lightrag_server/docker-compose.yml`)
- Added explicit environment variables for timeout settings
- Added health check for container monitoring
- Configured proper networking with `host.docker.internal`

### 4. Processing Optimizations
- **Chunk Size**: Reduced from 10,000 to 1,024 bytes for better reliability
- **Retry Logic**: Increased max retries from 3 to 5
- **Retry Delay**: Increased from 30 to 60 seconds
- **Backoff Strategy**: Added exponential backoff with factor 2.0
- **Concurrency**: Limited to 1 concurrent request to prevent resource exhaustion

## Verification Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Server health check
- ✅ Model configuration test
- ✅ Document upload endpoint accessibility

## Key Benefits

1. **Timeout Resilience**: 2-hour timeout windows prevent premature connection drops
2. **Better Model Performance**: 7B model handles complex PDF processing more efficiently
3. **Improved Reliability**: Enhanced retry logic with exponential backoff
4. **Resource Optimization**: Smaller chunks prevent memory issues
5. **Connection Stability**: Keep-alive settings maintain persistent connections

## Usage Recommendations

### For PDF Processing:
1. **Start Small**: Test with smaller PDF files first (< 10MB)
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch container logs during processing
3. **Be Patient**: Large documents may take significant time to process
4. **Check Progress**: Use the document status endpoints to monitor progress

### Monitoring Commands:
```bash
# Check container status
cd lightrag_server && docker-compose ps

# Monitor logs
cd lightrag_server && docker-compose logs -f

# Test server health
python test_lightrag_timeout_fix.py
```

## Files Modified

1. `lightrag_server/env.server` - Updated timeout and model configuration
2. `lightrag_server/config.ini` - Enhanced processing and timeout settings
3. `lightrag_server/docker-compose.yml` - Added environment variables and health check
4. `test_lightrag_timeout_fix.py` - Created verification script

## Expected Behavior

- **Before**: Frequent `httpx.ReadTimeout` errors during PDF processing
- **After**: Robust processing with proper timeout handling and retry logic
- **Processing Time**: Longer but more reliable processing of complex documents
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff on failures

## Troubleshooting

If timeout issues persist:
1. Check Ollama server status: `ollama list`
2. Verify model is loaded: `ollama run qwen2.5:latest "test"`
3. Monitor system resources during processing
4. Consider further reducing chunk size if memory issues occur
5. Check Docker container logs for specific error messages

The implemented fixes address the root causes of the timeout issues and provide a more robust document processing pipeline.
