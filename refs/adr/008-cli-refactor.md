# 8. CLI Refactor for Maintainability

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Context:** The `src/personal_agent/agno_main.py` file had grown significantly in size and complexity, mixing responsibilities such as CLI command parsing, memory-related functions, and agent initialization logic. This led to reduced maintainability, testability, and extensibility.
*   **Decision:** To improve maintainability and organization, the `agno_main.py` file was refactored by extracting memory-related CLI commands and initialization logic into separate, focused modules. This involved creating a new `src/personal_agent/cli/` package for CLI-related functionalities and a dedicated `src/personal_agent/core/agno_initialization.py` module for complex initialization logic.

    **New File Structure:**

    ```
    src/personal_agent/cli/
    ├── __init__.py                 # Package initialization and exports
    ├── memory_commands.py          # All memory-related CLI functions
    ├── command_parser.py           # Command parsing and routing logic
    └── agno_cli.py                # Main CLI interface logic
    ```

    ```
    src/personal_agent/core/agno_initialization.py  # Complex initialization logic
    ```

*   **Consequences:**
    *   **Positive:**
        *   **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module now has a clear, focused purpose, improving code clarity and organization.
        *   **Improved Maintainability:** Memory commands and CLI logic are easier to find, modify, and manage.
        *   **Better Testability:** Individual components can be unit tested independently.
        *   **Enhanced Extensibility:** Adding new CLI commands or extending existing functionalities is now more straightforward.
        *   **Improved Readability:** The main CLI file (`agno_main.py`) is significantly shorter and easier to understand.
        *   **Backward Compatibility:** All existing CLI functionality and command syntax are preserved.
    *   **Negative:**
        *   Introduces a few new files and directories, slightly increasing the overall file count, but this is offset by the improved modularity and reduced complexity within individual files.
