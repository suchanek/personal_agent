# Refactored Agent Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the refactored architecture of the AgnoPersonalAgent system, which has been modularized from a monolithic 2800+ line class into a set of specialized manager classes. This refactoring improves maintainability, testability, and follows the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Architecture Overview

The refactored system consists of the following components:

```
AgnoPersonalAgent (Main coordinator class)
├── AgentModelManager (Manages model creation and configuration)
├── AgentInstructionManager (Manages agent instructions)
├── AgentMemoryManager (Manages memory operations)
├── AgentKnowledgeManager (Manages knowledge bases)
└── AgentToolManager (Manages tool creation and execution)
```

## Component Details

### 1. AgentModelManager

**Location**: `src/personal_agent/core/agent_model_manager.py`

**Purpose**: Handles model creation and configuration for different LLM providers.

### 2. AgentInstructionManager

**Location**: `src/personal_agent/core/agent_instruction_manager.py`

**Purpose**: Manages the creation and customization of agent instructions based on sophistication levels.

### 3. AgentMemoryManager

**Location**: `src/personal_agent/core/agent_memory_manager.py`

**Purpose**: Manages all memory operations including storage, retrieval, and updates across both local SQLite and LightRAG graph systems.

### 4. AgentKnowledgeManager

**Location**: `src/personal_agent/core/agent_knowledge_manager.py`

**Purpose**: Manages knowledge bases and knowledge-related operations including facts, preferences, entities, and relationships.

### 5. AgentToolManager

**Location**: `src/personal_agent/core/agent_tool_manager.py`

**Purpose**: Manages tool registration, validation, execution, and configuration.

### 6. Refactored AgnoPersonalAgent

**Location**: `src/personal_agent/core/agno_agent_new.py` (will replace original)

**Purpose**: Acts as a coordinator between all manager components, maintaining the same public API for backward compatibility.
