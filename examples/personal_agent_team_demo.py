Personal Agent Team Demo

This script demonstrates the new team-based approach where specialized agents
work together instead of having one large agent that does everything.

The team consists of:
- Memory Agent: Specialized in storing and retrieving personal information
- Web Research Agent: Specialized in web searches and current events
- Finance Agent: Specialized in financial data and stock analysis
- Calculator Agent: Specialized in mathematical calculations
- File Operations Agent: Specialized in file system operations

A team coordinator uses reasoning to delegate tasks to the appropriate agents.
