# ADR-084: Standalone Memory Functions for Improved Modularity

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Author**: Gemini

## Context and Problem Statement

The previous architecture had memory management logic duplicated across multiple components:
- `AgnoPersonalAgent` class methods
- `PersagMemoryTools` toolkit class
- `StreamlitMemoryHelper` class for the UI

This duplication led to several issues:
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Changes to memory logic had to be manually synchronized across multiple files.
- **Inconsistency**: Subtle differences in implementation could lead to inconsistent behavior.
- **Code Bloat**: The `AgnoPersonalAgent` class was becoming overly large and violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Reduced Reusability**: It was difficult to reuse memory functions in new components without depending on a full agent instance or a specific toolkit.

A more modular and centralized approach was needed to address these challenges.

## Decision Drivers

- Improve code maintainability and reduce technical debt.
- Ensure consistent memory management behavior across the entire application.
- Simplify the architecture and improve separation of concerns.
- Enhance the reusability of memory functions.

## Considered Options

1.  **Keep the existing architecture**: Continue with duplicated logic and accept the maintenance overhead. This was rejected as it would exacerbate the existing problems.
2.  **Create a new `MemoryManager` facade**: Introduce a new class that would act as a single entry point for all memory operations. This was a viable option but would still require passing around an instance of this new class.
3.  **Implement standalone memory functions**: Create a new module with standalone functions that take an agent instance as a parameter. This approach offers the most flexibility and reusability.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Implement standalone memory functions**.

A new module, `src/personal_agent/tools/memory_functions.py`, has been created to house all memory-related operations (e.g., `store_user_memory`, `query_memory`, `list_all_memories`).

These functions are designed to be self-contained and operate on a personal agent instance passed as an argument. They delegate the actual memory operations to the agent's `memory_manager`.

### Architectural Changes

- **`src/personal_agent/tools/memory_functions.py`**: This new module is now the single source of truth for all memory operations.
- **`src/personal_agent/core/agno_agent.py`**: The `AgnoPersonalAgent` class has been refactored. Its public memory methods are now thin wrappers that call the corresponding standalone functions from `memory_functions.py`.
- **`src/personal_agent/tools/persag_memory_tools.py`**: The `PersagMemoryTools` class has been deprecated. It now simply re-exports the standalone functions for backward compatibility.
- **`src/personal_agent/tools/streamlit_helpers.py`**: The `StreamlitMemoryHelper` class has been updated to use the new standalone memory functions, simplifying its implementation.

### Benefits

- **Single Source of Truth**: All memory logic is now centralized in one place, making it easier to maintain and update.
- **Reduced Duplication**: The new architecture eliminates redundant code, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.
- **Improved Modularity**: The memory functions are now decoupled from the agent and other components, improving the overall modularity of the system.
- **Enhanced Reusability**: The standalone functions can be easily imported and used in any part of the application that has access to an agent instance.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The codebase is cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to understand.
- Future development of memory-related features will be faster and less error-prone.
- The risk of inconsistent behavior is significantly reduced.

### Negative

- This is a significant refactoring that touches several core components of the application. Thorough testing is required to ensure that there are no regressions.
