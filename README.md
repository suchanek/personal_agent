# Personal AI Agent

A modern, production-ready personal AI assistant built with the Agno framework, featuring comprehensive memory management, knowledge base integration, and local privacy. The Personal Agent Program introduces an advanced AI system designed to support individuals with memory challenges by preserving their memories, wisdom, and connections, while ensuring that every individual's intellectual contributions are preserved for future generations.

## ✨ Latest Updates

The Streamlit web interface has been significantly upgraded to provide a unified experience for both single-agent and multi-agent team interactions.

- **Unified Dual-Mode UI**: A single, powerful interface (`poetry run paga`) now manages both the single personal agent and the multi-agent team.
- **Dynamic Mode Switching**: Seamlessly switch between single-agent and team modes directly within the UI.
- **New `paga_streamlit_agno.py`**: This new script is the primary entry point for the web UI, replacing the older `persag_app.py`.
- **Deprecation of `paga_team_cli`**: The separate command-line interface for the team has been deprecated in favor of the new unified Streamlit application.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **🚀 Quick Start**: Run `poetry run paga` for the new unified Streamlit web interface or `poetry run paga_cli` for command-line interaction.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.11 or higher
- **Poetry**: For dependency management
- **Docker**: For LightRAG services
- **Ollama**: For local LLM inference
- **Node.js**: For MCP servers (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone and Setup**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd personal_agent
poetry install
```

2. **Start LightRAG Services**

Use the provided helper scripts to start and manage the LightRAG services:

```bash
# Smart restart with user synchronization
./smart-restart-lightrag.sh
```

3. **Setup Ollama**

First, install Ollama on your system.

```bash
# Install Ollama (macOS)
# IMPORTANT: For GPU acceleration on Mac, download the official app from https://ollama.com
# Do NOT use 'brew install ollama' as it may not support Metal acceleration.

# After installing, pull the recommended models:
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b-instruct
ollama pull qwen3:8b
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

To run Ollama as a robust background service with the optimal settings for this project, follow these steps to create a startup script and a system service. These *must* be done in a terminal with root privileges, hence the `sudo` command.

**Step 1: Prepare the Startup Script**

This project includes a recommended startup script for Ollama at `scripts/start_ollama.sh`. To use it, copy it to a personal binary directory (e.g., `~/bin`) so that it can be reliably found by the system service.

```bash
# Create the ~/bin directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/bin

# Copy the script
cp scripts/start_ollama.sh /usr/local/bin/start_ollama.sh

# Make the script executable
chmod +x /usr/local/binstart_ollama.sh
```

**Step 2: Create the System Service (macOS)**

This project includes a `launchd` service file at `scripts/com.personal-agent.ollama.plist`. This service will automatically run the `start_ollama.sh` script in the background.

To install it, copy the file to your `/Library/LaunchAgents` directory.

```bash

# Copy the service file
sudo cp scripts/com.personal-agent.ollama.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/com.personal-agent.ollama.plist
```

**Step 3: Start the Service**

Load and start the new service. If you have the official Ollama app, make sure it is not running to avoid conflicts.

```bash

# Load and start your new custom service
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.personal-agent.ollama.plist
sudo launchctl start com.personal-agent.ollama
```

You can check the status and logs with:
```bash
# Check if the service is running
sudo launchctl list | grep com.personal-agent.ollama

# View the logs
tail -f /Library/Logs/ollama.log
```

4. **Install Poetry**

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. If you don't have it installed, you can install it by running:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
Follow the instructions to add Poetry to your shell's `PATH`.

5. **Install Poe the Poet**

[Poe the Poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) is used as a task runner for this project, allowing you to use simple commands like `poe cli`. It is installed as a poetry plugin, so it should be installed automatically when you run `poetry install`.

If for some reason it is not available, you can install it manually:
```bash
poetry self add poethepoet
```

6. **Configure Environment**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Required: User and data configuration
USER_ID=your_username
PERSAG_ROOT=/Users/your_username/.persag

# Optional: API keys for enhanced functionality
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

5. **Start the Agent**

```bash
# Web interface (recommended, defaults to team mode)
poe serve-persag

# To start the web interface in single-agent mode
poe serve-persag --single

# CLI interface (single-agent only)
poe cli
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` for the Streamlit interface.

## 💻 Usage

"Remember that I work as a software engineer at Google"

# Search memories
"What do you know about my work?"

# View all memories
Use the "Show All Memories" button in the web interface
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

The agent can be configured using a `.env` file in the project root.

```bash
