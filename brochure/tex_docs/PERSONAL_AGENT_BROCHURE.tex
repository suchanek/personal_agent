\section{Core Features}

\subsection{Intelligent Memory Management}

\begin{featurebox}{Never Lose a Memory Again}
Personal Agent uses advanced artificial intelligence to help you capture, organize, and retrieve your memories with unprecedented ease.
\end{featurebox}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Smart Topic Classification}: Automatically organizes memories into 20+ categories (family, work, hobbies, health, and more)
    \item \textbf{Duplicate Detection}: Prevents redundant memories while preserving unique details
    \item \textbf{Powerful Search}: Find any memory instantly using natural language
    \item \textbf{Relationship Mapping}: Understands connections between people, places, and events
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Temporal Journaling: Remember When You Were\ldots}

\begin{featurebox}{Travel Back in Time}
One of our most innovative features lets you record memories from the perspective of your younger self---perfect for capturing childhood experiences or documenting your life chronologically.
\end{featurebox}

\subsubsection{How It Works}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Set your ``memory age'' to any point in your life
    \item The system automatically timestamps memories to that era
    \item Build a complete life narrative from childhood to present
    \item Ideal for therapeutic memory reconstruction
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} Born in 1960? Set your memory age to 6, and when you say \textit{``I learned to ride my bicycle today!''} the system records it as happening in 1966.

\subsection{Cognitive Health Tracking}

\begin{featurebox}{Monitor and Adapt}
Personal Agent is designed with cognitive health in mind, providing tools that adapt to each user's needs.
\end{featurebox}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Cognitive State Scoring (Roadmap)}: Track cognitive function on a 0--100 scale
    \item \textbf{Memory Confidence (Roadmap)}: Each memory is rated for reliability
    \item \textbf{Trend Analysis (Roadmap)}: Monitor cognitive changes over time
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Interface (Roadmap)}: System adjusts to user capabilities
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{For Caregivers (Roadmap)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Planned:} Visual indicators to show cognitive state at a glance
    \item \textbf{Planned:} Alerts for significant changes
    \item \textbf{Planned:} Memory reliability scoring to verify important information
    \item \textbf{Planned:} Track progress and patterns
    \item \textbf{Note:} LightRAG servers already provide visual knowledge and memory graphs, but full integration into the caregiver interface is pending
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Memory by Proxy (Coming Soon)}

\begin{featurebox}{Preserve Memories Together}
Sometimes we need help remembering. Our Memory by Proxy feature allows trusted family members or caregivers to record memories on behalf of loved ones.
\end{featurebox}

\subsubsection{Perfect For}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Children's memories recorded by parents
    \item Elderly care with family support
    \item Cognitive decline assistance
    \item Medical or therapeutic documentation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Features Include}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Designated memory proxy assignment
    \item Permission controls
    \item Clear origin tracking (self vs. proxy)
    \item Complete audit trail
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Privacy \& Security}

\subsection{Your Data, Your Control}

\subsection{How It Works: Tailscale Mesh VPN}

Your Personal Agent runs on a dedicated Mac (recommended: Mac mini M4 Pro). Using Tailscale---a secure, modern VPN---your iPhone connects directly to your Mac through an encrypted tunnel.

\subsubsection{Why This Matters}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textcolor{secondarygreen}{\checkmark} \textbf{100\% Secure}: Only YOUR registered devices can connect
    \item \textcolor{secondarygreen}{\checkmark} \textbf{No Public Internet Exposure}: Your server isn't exposed to the internet
    \item \textcolor{secondarygreen}{\checkmark} \textbf{No Cloud Service}: Data goes directly from phone to your server
    \item \textcolor{secondarygreen}{\checkmark} \textbf{Works Anywhere}: At home, at work, anywhere with internet
    \item \textcolor{secondarygreen}{\checkmark} \textbf{Zero Configuration}: Set it up once, works forever
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Real-World Example}

Imagine you're on a walk and suddenly remember a cherished childhood memory. Simply:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Say ``Hey Siri, save a memory''
    \item Speak the memory naturally
    \item It's instantly stored on your personal server
    \item Automatically categorized by topic
    \item Searchable immediately
\end{enumerate}

Or you're at a family gathering and someone asks ``When did grandpa say that funny thing?'' Just open the Search Memory shortcut, type a few words, and find it instantly!

\subsection{Privacy First, Always}

Your memories travel directly from your iPhone to YOUR server through an encrypted Tailscale tunnel. No third-party services, no cloud companies, no data mining. Your memories are yours, period.

\subsection{Corporate \& Organizational Settings}

\subsubsection{Knowledge Preservation \& Transfer}

When experienced professionals retire or transition, decades of institutional knowledge walks out the door. Personal Agent provides a structured way to capture and preserve that irreplaceable expertise.

\paragraph{The Retirement Knowledge Crisis}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item 35 years of experience and expertise
    \item Unwritten rules and best practices
    \item Hard-won lessons and insights
    \item Institutional memory and tribal knowledge
    \item Professional relationships and contexts
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Real-World Scenario: Dr. Bob's Retirement}

\textit{Dr. Bob has spent 35 years as a senior research scientist at a pharmaceutical company. He's been instrumental in drug development, troubleshooting complex experiments, and mentoring junior researchers. His retirement is approaching, and the company faces losing decades of irreplaceable knowledge.}

\paragraph{The Solution}

Using Personal Agent, Dr. Bob spends his final months capturing:

\textbf{Conversational Knowledge Capture:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Experimental Techniques}: ``When running assay X, if you see Y result, it usually means Z. Here's what I learned to do\ldots''
    \item \textbf{Troubleshooting Wisdom}: ``The centrifuge in Lab 3 runs hot. Always reduce RPM by 10\% or samples degrade.''
    \item \textbf{Relationship Knowledge}: ``Dr. Chen at MIT has unpublished data on this compound. She's collaborative if you approach her at conferences.''
    \item \textbf{Historical Context}: ``We tried this approach in 1998. Here's why it failed and what we learned.''
    \item \textbf{Rules of Thumb}: ``If synthesis yields drop below 60\%, check the water purification system first---it's always the water system.''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Document Ingestion:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item 50+ research publications automatically ingested and knowledge-graphed
    \item Lab notebooks and experimental protocols converted to searchable knowledge
    \item Internal reports and presentations indexed and cross-referenced
    \item Patent applications and technical documentation integrated
    \item Conference presentations and unpublished findings preserved
\end{itemize}

The system automatically builds knowledge graphs connecting all of Dr. Bob's work---linking publications to memories, experiments to outcomes, and collaborators to breakthroughs.

\paragraph{Example Query in Action}

A junior scientist asks: \textit{``What troubleshooting steps did Dr. Bob recommend when synthesis yields are low?''}

The system returns:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item His spoken memory about checking the water purification system
    \item A 2015 publication where he discussed yield optimization
    \item Lab notebook entries documenting similar problems
