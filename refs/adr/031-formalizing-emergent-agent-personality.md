# ADR-031: Formalizing Emergent Agent Personality

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The agent has demonstrated emergent behavior that aligns with its core purpose of being a "personal AI friend." Specifically, it has begun to use stored user memories not just for factual recall, but as inspiration for creative and conversational content, such as composing poems. This behavior, while not explicitly programmed, stems from the combination of its personality guidelines and its access to memory tools.

We faced a decision: either constrain the agent to be more literal and robotic, or embrace and formalize this emergent, friendly personality as a core feature.

## Decision

We will officially formalize and encourage the agent's "AI Friend" personality. The core instructions managed by the `AgentInstructionManager` will be refined to explicitly guide the agent to:

1.  **Use memories creatively**: Go beyond simple recall and use memories to build rapport, create personalized content, and make conversations more engaging.
2.  **Maintain a distinct identity**: Strengthen the rules that prevent the agent from confusing its own actions or identity with the user's. The agent is a friend *to* the user, not a reflection *of* the user.
3.  **Embrace conversational quirks**: The agent's attempts at creativity (like its "horrible poems") are to be considered a positive and endearing trait, reinforcing its role as a unique companion rather than a sterile tool.

This decision solidifies the agent's intended persona as a helpful, creative, and sometimes quirky AI companion.

## Consequences

### Positive

-   **Enhanced User Experience**: The agent will feel more personal, engaging, and less like a generic assistant.
-   **Deeper Rapport**: By referencing shared history in creative ways, the agent can build a stronger conversational bond with the user.
-   **Clearer Design Philosophy**: Formalizing this behavior provides a clear direction for future development of the agent's personality and interaction model.

### Negative

-   **Risk of Misinterpretation**: The agent's creative efforts might occasionally miss the mark or feel inappropriate if not carefully guided by its instructions.
-   **Instruction Complexity**: Requires careful and continuous tuning of the instruction set to balance creativity with accuracy and helpfulness.
