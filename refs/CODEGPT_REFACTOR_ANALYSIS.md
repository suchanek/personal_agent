I'll re-analyze the codebase to understand the current structure after your refactoring. Let me start by exploring the repository structure and key components.

Now let me check the main entry points and core components to understand the refactored structure:

Let me check the core Agno agent implementation:

Let me check the CLI interface and configuration:

Now let me check the configuration and settings structure:

Now let me check the web interfaces and Streamlit dashboard:

Let me check the memory management functionality:

Let me also check the MCP tools and server configuration:

Now let me check some recent tools and team functionality:

Based on my comprehensive analysis of the refactored codebase on branch `refactor/v0.8.12`, here's what I've discovered about the current structure:

## üîÑ **Refactored Architecture Overview**

The Personal Agent has been significantly refactored with a well-organized modular architecture:

### **üèóÔ∏è Core Structure**

**Main Entry Points:**
- `src/personal_agent/agno_main.py` - Primary CLI entry point using Agno framework
- `src/personal_agent/smol_main.py` - SmolAgent-based alternative 
- `src/personal_agent/langchain_main.py` - Legacy LangChain implementation

**Core Components:**
- `src/personal_agent/core/agno_agent.py::AgnoPersonalAgent` - Main agent class with comprehensive memory and MCP integration
- `src/personal_agent/core/semantic_memory_manager.py::SemanticMemoryManager` - LLM-free memory management with semantic search
- `src/personal_agent/core/user_manager.py::UserManager` - Multi-user system with runtime switching
- `src/personal_agent/core/lightrag_manager.py` - Knowledge graph management via LightRAG

### **üß† Memory & Knowledge System**

**Dual Memory Architecture:**
- **Local SQLite**: Semantic memory with duplicate detection and topic classification
- **LightRAG Graph**: Distributed knowledge graph for complex relationships
- **Agno Native Storage**: Vector database integration for semantic search

**Key Features:**
- Semantic duplicate detection with configurable similarity thresholds
- Automatic topic classification using YAML-based rules
- Enhanced query expansion for better search results
- Multi-user memory isolation

### **üîß Configuration & Settings**

**Centralized Configuration:**
- `src/personal_agent/config/settings.py` - Environment-based configuration with user-specific paths
- `src/personal_agent/config/mcp_servers.py` - MCP server definitions for external tool integration
- `src/personal_agent/config/model_contexts.py` - Model context size management

**Dynamic User Management:**
- Runtime user switching via `env.userid` file
- User-specific storage paths and memory isolation
- Automatic directory creation for new users

### **üåê Multiple Interfaces**

**Web Interfaces:**
- `src/personal_agent/web/agno_interface.py` - Modern Flask-based web interface
- `src/personal_agent/streamlit/dashboard.py` - Comprehensive management dashboard

**CLI Interface:**
- `src/personal_agent/cli/agno_cli.py::run_agno_cli` - Enhanced CLI with command parsing
- Memory management commands and system status

### **üõ†Ô∏è Tool Ecosystem**

**MCP Integration:**
- Filesystem operations (home, data, root access)
- GitHub repository management
- Web search via Brave API
- Browser automation with Puppeteer
- AI-powered research assistant

**Native Tools:**
- `src/personal_agent/tools/memory_tools.py` - Memory operations
- `src/personal_agent/tools/filesystem.py` - File system operations
- `src/personal_agent/tools/web.py` - Web browsing and research
- `src/personal_agent/tools/personal_agent_tools.py` - Agent-specific utilities

### **üë• Team & Multi-Agent Support**

**Specialized Agents:**
- `src/personal_agent/team/specialized_agents.py` - Individual specialized agents
- `src/personal_agent/team/multi_agent_team.py` - Coordinated team operations
- `src/personal_agent/core/multi_agent_system.py` - Multi-agent coordination system

### **üìä Monitoring & Management**

**Streamlit Dashboard Components:**
- System status monitoring
- User management interface
- Memory management tools
- Docker service management

**Utilities:**
- `src/personal_agent/utils/pag_logging.py` - Centralized logging
- `src/personal_agent/utils/cleanup.py` - Resource cleanup
- `src/personal_agent/utils/splash_screen.py` - User interface enhancements

## üöÄ **Key Improvements in v0.8.12**

1. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated modules
2. **Enhanced Memory System**: LLM-free semantic memory with improved search capabilities
3. **Multi-User Support**: Runtime user switching with complete data isolation
4. **MCP Integration**: Native support for Model Context Protocol tools
5. **Multiple Interfaces**: CLI, Web, and Streamlit dashboard options
6. **Team Coordination**: Multi-agent system for complex task handling
7. **Comprehensive Configuration**: Environment-based settings with dynamic user paths

The refactored codebase shows a mature, production-ready personal AI assistant with sophisticated memory management, multi-user capabilities, and extensive tool integration through the Agno framework.
