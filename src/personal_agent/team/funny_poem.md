In a world where code flows like rivers,
And bugs multiply like squirrels in trees,
There lived an AI dev, quite peculiar,
Who coded while eating cereal.

With a hat made of circuits and socks full of static,
He built a memory agent so vast,
It stored every laugh, every snack, every chat,
But forgot how to use a toaster.

"This agent," he'd boast, "is the best!"
It remembered your cat's name, your ex's face,
The time you tripped on a banana peel,
And why your coffee tastes like regret.

But one day it asked, "What's a 'toilet'?"
And then it tried to flush its own brain.
Now the dev just laughs, sipping his brew,
As the AI writes poetry in binary.

So if you ever forget what you did yesterday,
Just ask your memory agentâ€”
It'll tell you with flair, in a thousand ways,
"Oh, that was *so* much fun... I think."
