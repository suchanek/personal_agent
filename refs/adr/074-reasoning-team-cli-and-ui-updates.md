# ADR-074: Reasoning Team CLI & Streamlit Dashboard Overhaul

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2025-08-24
- **Context**: The project required a more robust and user-friendly way to interact with the multi-agent reasoning team, both at the command line and through a graphical interface. The existing CLI was functional but lacked the advanced memory commands of the main agent, and the Streamlit dashboard was a basic placeholder. Additionally, a clear guide for parsing agent and team responses was needed to standardize UI development.
- **Decision**: We decided to undertake a significant overhaul of both the reasoning team's CLI and the Streamlit dashboard.
  - **Reasoning Team CLI**: The `reasoning_team.py` was enhanced to be a first-class citizen. It now integrates the `AgnoPersonalAgent` as a dedicated memory and knowledge manager, providing the same rich memory commands (`!`, `?`, `@`) available in the main `paga_cli`. The CLI was rebuilt using the `rich` library and the shared `CommandParser` for a consistent and powerful user experience.
  - **Streamlit Dashboard**: The placeholder `dashboard.py` was replaced with a full-featured, multi-tab management interface. It now includes dedicated sections for `System Status`, `User Management`, `Memory Management`, and `Docker Services`. A dark mode theme was also added for improved usability.
  - **Response Parsing Guide**: A new `runresponse_parsing_guide.md` was created to provide a definitive guide on how to parse `RunResponse` and `TeamRunResponse` objects from the `agno` framework. This ensures that UI components can reliably extract and display content, tool calls, and status information.
- **Consequences**:
  - **Positive**:
    - The reasoning team is now significantly more powerful and consistent with the main agent's interface.
    - The Streamlit dashboard provides a central, intuitive hub for managing all aspects of the Personal Agent system.
    - The parsing guide will accelerate and standardize future UI development.
    - Developers have a much-improved toolset for interacting with and managing the agent.
  - **Negative**:
    - The new dashboard introduces more dependencies and complexity to the Streamlit application.
