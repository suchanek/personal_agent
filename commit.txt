feat(ui): Add dynamic memory dates and fix user switching
    2 
    3 Implements dynamic, human-readable timestamps (e.g., "3 days ago," "at age 
      25") for memories displayed in both the main Streamlit agent UI and the 
      standalone management dashboard. This provides a more intuitive and 
      chronological context for user memories.

      functionality, ensuring reliable context changes in the multi-user system.
