# Personal Agent Integration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate the LightRAG server with the personal agent project.

## Key Changes:

*   **`GEMINI.md`**: This file has been significantly updated to reflect the integration with `RAGAnything`. It now includes:
    *   A detailed overview of `RAGAnything`'s features.
    *   Installation and usage instructions for the `raganything` package.
    *   A new section documenting the LightRAG Server API, including its endpoints and key characteristics like authentication and versioning.

*   **`requirements.txt`**: The `raganything` package has been added as a dependency. This is a crucial change that ensures the `RAGAnything` library is installed alongside other project dependencies, making its functionality available to the application.

*   **Docker Configuration (`Dockerfile`)**: The Docker configuration has been substantially modified to:
    *   **Tailor the image for the personal agent:** The `Dockerfile` has been updated to create a specialized Docker image that includes all the necessary dependencies and configurations for the personal agent project.
    *   **Integrate `RAGAnything`:** The Docker build process now correctly installs the `raganything` library, ensuring it's available within the containerized environment.

In essence, these changes represent a significant step in integrating the LightRAG server with the personal agent project. The updated documentation, the inclusion of the `raganything` dependency, and the tailored Docker configuration all work together to create a robust and feature-rich environment for the application.
