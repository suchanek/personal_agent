# Personal Agent Scripts Cheatsheet

This document provides a quick reference for the various scripts and tools available in this project, with a focus on memory and document management.

## üß† Memory & Fact Management

These scripts are for managing the agent's semantic and graph memories, and for injecting personal facts.

| Script | Description | Usage Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tools/clear_all_memories.py` | **(Recommended)** Clears memories from BOTH local SQLite and LightRAG graph systems. Prevents data drift. | `python tools/clear_all_memories.py` |
| `tools/memory_manager_tool.py` | An interactive tool to inspect the memory database, view/delete memories by user, search, and get stats. | `python tools/memory_manager_tool.py` |
| `tools/inject_eric_facts_v2.py` | **(Modern)** Injects personal facts using the `SemanticMemoryManager` with auto-topic classification and dual storage. | `python tools/inject_eric_facts_v2.py --clear-first` |
| `scripts/auto_send_facts.py` | A fully automated script to send personal facts directly to the agent and monitor for success. | `python scripts/auto_send_facts.py all` |
| `scripts/clear_lightrag_memory_data.py` | A low-level script to clear specific data files from the LightRAG memory storage directories. | `python scripts/clear_lightrag_memory_data.py` |
| `scripts/send_facts_helper.py` | A helper to generate formatted fact messages to be copy-pasted into the chat UI. | `python scripts/send_facts_helper.py all` |
| `scripts/store_fact.py` | A simple utility to store a single fact directly into the knowledge base. | `python scripts/store_fact.py "My cat's name is Luna"` |
| `tools/initialize_eric_memories.py` | (Legacy) The original script for feeding facts to the agent one-by-one. | `python tools/initialize_eric_memories.py all` |

## üìÑ Document & Knowledge Base Management

Tools for managing documents within the LightRAG knowledge base.

| Script | Description | Usage Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tools/docmgr.py` | **(Modern/Recommended)** Manages LightRAG documents by integrating directly with the agent's tools. Handles listing, deleting, and retrying. | `python tools/docmgr.py --list` |
| `scripts/send_to_lightrag.py` | Sends a local file to the LightRAG server for ingestion into the knowledge base. | `python scripts/send_to_lightrag.py my_document.pdf` |
| `scripts/delete_lightrag_documents_enhanced.py` | An advanced tool for deleting documents with options for persistent storage removal and Docker management. | `python scripts/delete_lightrag_documents_enhanced.py --delete-failed --persistent` |
| `tools/lightrag_docmgr_v2.py` | (Legacy) Manages LightRAG documents using direct API calls. | `python tools/lightrag_docmgr_v2.py --list` |
| `tools/docmgr_wrapper.sh` | (Legacy) A wrapper for an older version of the document manager. | `./tools/docmgr_wrapper.sh --delete-name '*.pdf'` |
