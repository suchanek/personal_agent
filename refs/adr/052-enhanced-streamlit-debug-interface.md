# 52. Enhanced Streamlit Debug and Response Handling

- **Date**: 2025-08-06
- **Status**: Accepted

## Context

The existing Streamlit web interface (`agno_interface.py`) was functional for basic interaction but lacked detailed, real-time debugging capabilities. It was difficult to inspect the agent's tool calls, performance metrics, and the raw data from agent responses, which hindered development and troubleshooting.

## Decision

To address this, we will significantly enhance the Streamlit interface with a comprehensive debug sidebar and improved response handling logic:

1.  **Refactor `agno_interface.py`**: The main interface will be updated to include a dedicated debug section in the sidebar with toggles for displaying tool calls and performance metrics.

2.  **Standardized Tool Call Formatting**: A new `format_tool_call_for_debug` function will be implemented to standardize the format of tool calls, ensuring consistent and detailed display of tool names, arguments, results, and status.

3.  **Improved Response Extraction**: The `extract_response_content` function will be improved to reliably extract not just the final content, but also detailed metrics and tool call information from the agent's responses.

4.  **Real-time Tool Call Display**: The agent's `run` method will be updated to collect tool calls as they happen during streaming, and a new `get_last_tool_calls` method will make them available to the interface for real-time display.

5.  **Performance Metrics**: The interface will now track and display key performance indicators, including response times, token counts, and a trend chart for response times.

## Consequences

- **Improved Developer Experience**: The new debug interface provides a much-richer environment for inspecting and understanding the agent's behavior.
- **Enhanced Transparency**: It is now much easier to see what the agent is doing under the hood, which is crucial for debugging and building trust in the system.
- **Better Performance Analysis**: The performance metrics provide valuable insights into the agent's efficiency and help identify bottlenecks.
