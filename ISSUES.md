# Running Issues and Todos
- (v0.11.3) 2025-07-21 23:38:39: the DATA_DIR should really map into the user_id space rather than the current approach.
- (v0.11.3) 2025-07-21 23:39:42: we have the @src/personal_agent/tools/filesystem.py that correctly uses the mcp filesystem tools and directories. should we just use those?
