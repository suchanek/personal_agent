## Test Directory Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup actions performed on the `tests/` directory to improve organization and remove redundant or obsolete files.

### Actions Taken:

1.  **Removed Debug Scripts:** All files prefixed with `debug_` (e.g., `debug_agent_tools.py`, `debug_github_direct.py`) were removed as they were temporary debugging scripts.

2.  **Consolidated README Files:** The content from `README_memory_capability_tests.md` and `README_tool_call_debug_test.md` was merged into the main `README.md` within the `tests/` directory, and the individual files were then deleted.

3.  **Eliminated Redundant Test Runners:**
    *   `run_all_tests.py`
    *   `run_debug_test.py`
    *   `run_fact_recall_tests.py`
    *   `run_memory_capability_tests.py`
    *   `run_validation_test.py`
    These scripts were removed because `run_tests.py` serves as the primary and more versatile test runner, capable of executing individual tests.

4.  **Removed Empty Test Files:**
    *   `test_filesystem_comprehensive.py`
    *   `test_github_mcp_direct.py`
    These files were empty and served no purpose.

5.  **Consolidated Similar Test Files:** In cases where multiple test files covered similar functionality, the most comprehensive or relevant version was retained, and the others were removed. Specific consolidations include:
    *   `test_agent_init.py` was removed (retained `test_agent_initialization.py`).
    *   `test_cleanup.py` was removed (retained `test_cleanup_improved.py`).
    *   `test_file_writing_simple.py` was removed (retained `test_file_writing.py`).
    *   `test_knowledge_search.py` was removed (retained `test_knowledge_search_comprehensive.py`).
    *   `test_mcp.py` and `test_direct_mcp.py` were removed (retained `test_mcp_availability.py`).
    *   `test_direct_semantic_memory_capabilities.py` was removed (retained `test_memory_capabilities_standalone.py`).
    *   `test_ollama_selection.py` was removed (retained `test_ollama_selection_runtime.py`).
    *   `test_smolagents_web.py` was removed (retained `test_smolagents.py` and `test_smolagents_interaction.py`).
    *   `test_tools.py`, `test_tools_direct.py`, and `test_tools_directly.py` were removed (retained `test_tools_simple.py`).
    *   `test_web_interface.py` was removed (retained `test_web_detailed.py`).
    *   `test_absolute_direct.py` and `test_absolute_paths.py` were removed (retained `test_accessible_paths.py`).
    *   `test_filesystem_validation.py` was removed (retained `test_filesystem_paths.py`).
    *   `test_github_tools_final.py` was removed (retained `test_github.py`).
    *   `test_json_fix.py` was removed (retained `test_json_format_fix.py`).
    *   `test_memory_tools.py` was removed (retained `test_memory_system_comprehensive.py` and `test_memory_capabilities_standalone.py`).

6.  **Removed Troubleshooting/Analysis Scripts:**
    *   `fix_yfinance_401.py` (a troubleshooting script for a specific bug).
    *   `quick_knowledge_test.py` (a redundant quick test).

7.  **Moved Analysis Script:** `similarity_analysis.py` was moved from `tests/` to the `tools/` directory, as it is an analysis script rather than a test.

### Outcome:

The `tests/` directory is now significantly tidier, containing a more focused and relevant set of test files. This improves navigability and maintainability of the test suite.
