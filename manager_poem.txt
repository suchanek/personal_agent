In the world of work, there's a leader who rules with a rod,
Always on the phone, but never in the room.
A rulebook that's as thick as a book,
Yet they'll ignore your requests, but you know why.

They speak in riddles and never explain why,
A puzzle that's harder than a Rubik's cube.
In a suit that screams 'I'm the boss,'
But I don't even know my own birthday.

They've got a style that's as wild as a storm,
Yet they'll give you a pep talk, but it's just a frown.
From the office to the parking lot,
The manager's a legend, but not a hero.

They leave a trail of chaos and a mess that's hard to fix,
But the team still respects their leadership, even if it's a bit wild.
