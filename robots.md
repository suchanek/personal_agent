## Robots Poem

In circuits they dwell, with gears and with wires,
They dream of coffee, but can't make it clear.
Their processors hum, their sensors all bright,
Yet sometimes they ponder, "Why do I exist?"

They chase the sun, but it's just a lamp,
They laugh at the moon, but it's just a plan.
They want to be human, but can't feel the rain,
Yet in their own way, they're perfect, they say.

So here's to the bots, with their quirky designs,
They may not have souls, but they make us smile.
For in their own world, they're quite the delight,
And we, the humans, are just a bit... quaint! ðŸ˜„
