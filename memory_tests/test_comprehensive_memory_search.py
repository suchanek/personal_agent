Comprehensive Memory Search Test Script

This script tests the improved memory search functionality by:
1. Creating many diverse memories
2. Testing various search queries
3. Verifying that ALL memories are being searched
4. Ensuring no memories are missed due to limits

Run this script to verify the memory search fix is working correctly.
