# ADR-047: Robust Docker User Synchronization

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

The existing `DockerUserSync` class, responsible for ensuring USER_ID consistency between the main application and Docker services, lacked sufficient robustness. It had minimal input validation, inadequate error handling for file and subprocess operations, and a fragile reliance on a specific project structure. This could lead to silent failures, data corruption, and instability, especially in varied deployment environments.

To ensure system stability and data integrity, a comprehensive refactoring was necessary to make the synchronization process more resilient, predictable, and secure.

## Decision

We will refactor the `DockerUserSync` class to incorporate comprehensive validation, robust error handling, and improved operational logic. This overhaul will harden the entire user synchronization process against common failure modes.

### Key Enhancements:

- **Input Validation**: All public and internal methods will now rigorously validate their inputs (e.g., path existence, type checking, valid USER_ID formats) to prevent errors from propagating.
- **Error Handling**: Implement `try...except` blocks for all file I/O and `subprocess` calls to gracefully handle `OSError`, `TimeoutExpired`, and other common exceptions.
- **Atomic Operations**: Use atomic file writes (write to a temporary file, then rename) to prevent data corruption in `.env` files if an operation is interrupted.
- **Secure Subprocesses**: Add timeouts to all `subprocess.run` calls to prevent hangs. Use exact container name matching (`^container_name$`) to avoid ambiguity.
- **Robust Path Detection**: The `DockerIntegrationManager` will now use a more reliable method to detect the project root, making it less dependent on a rigid directory structure.
- **Improved Logging and Output**: Enhance logging with more detailed debug information and provide clearer, color-coded terminal output for better diagnostics.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: A new debug script (`debug_docker_user_sync_improvements.py`) has been created to thoroughly test all new improvements in a controlled environment.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Increased Stability**: The system is now far more resilient to errors during Docker synchronization, reducing the risk of runtime failures.
- **Improved Data Integrity**: Atomic writes and enhanced validation protect against data corruption in critical configuration files.
- **Enhanced Security**: Stricter validation of USER_IDs and more secure subprocess calls reduce potential security risks.
- **Better Maintainability**: The refactored code is cleaner, more predictable, and easier to debug, thanks to improved error handling and logging.

### Negative:
- **Increased Complexity**: The addition of comprehensive validation and error handling increases the code's complexity, requiring more careful maintenance.
