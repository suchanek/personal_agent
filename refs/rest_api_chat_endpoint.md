# REST API Chat Endpoint Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: âœ… Completed and Working

## Summary

Added a new `/api/v1/chat` endpoint to the REST API that allows external applications, shortcuts, and automation tools to interact with the personal agent via HTTP requests.

## Changes Made

### 1. REST API Endpoint ([rest_api.py](../src/personal_agent/tools/rest_api.py))

Added `POST /api/v1/chat` endpoint with the following features:
- Accepts JSON with `message` parameter (required)
- Automatically uses current system user from global configuration
- Returns structured JSON response with agent's reply
- Properly handles async tool execution

**Request Format:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "hello, how are you?"}'
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "hello, how are you?",
  "response": "Hello charlie!",
  "user_id": "charlie",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T16:56:13.510190"
}
```

### 2. API Documentation Update ([api_endpoints.py](../src/personal_agent/streamlit/components/api_endpoints.py))

- Added "Chat Endpoints" section to the API documentation
- Included usage examples with curl commands
- Updated discovery endpoint to list the new chat endpoint

### 3. Critical Bug Fix ([agno_agent.py](../src/personal_agent/core/agno_agent.py))

**Problem Discovered:**
The `AgnoPersonalAgent.run()` async method was incorrectly calling `super().run()` (synchronous) instead of `await super().arun()` (async), causing async tools like `store_user_memory` to fail with error:
```
Async function store_user_memory can't be used with synchronous agent.run()
```

**Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier:**
The Streamlit interface directly called `agent.arun()`, bypassing the broken `run()` method entirely. The bug only surfaced when implementing the REST API endpoint.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `super().run()` to `await super().arun()` in line 553
- Simplified non-streaming response handling to properly process single RunResponse objects
- Cleared Python cache to ensure changes loaded properly

## Key Design Decisions

### User ID Management
The endpoint uses the global configuration system (`get_current_user_id()` from `user_id_mgr.py`) rather than requiring user_id as a parameter. This approach:
- Simplifies remote API calls (no need to know/manage user IDs)
- Uses the current system user from `~/.persag/env.userid`
- Supports dynamic user switching via existing user management tools
- Returns user_id in response so caller knows which user processed the request

### Async Tool Support
The endpoint properly handles async operations by:
1. Using `agent.arun()` instead of `agent.run()`
2. Wrapping in `asyncio.run()` for execution in Flask's sync context
3. Properly awaiting async tool execution (memory storage, knowledge queries, etc.)

## Files Modified

1. `src/personal_agent/tools/rest_api.py` - Added chat endpoint
2. `src/personal_agent/streamlit/components/api_endpoints.py` - Updated documentation
3. `src/personal_agent/core/agno_agent.py` - Fixed async/sync mismatch bug

## Testing

Verified with curl command:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "hello, how are you?"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "message": "hello, how are you?",
  "response": "Hello charlie!",
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T16:56:13.510190",
  "user_id": "charlie"
}
```

## Use Cases

This endpoint enables:
- iOS/macOS Shortcuts integration
- Home automation triggers
- External application integration
- Command-line scripts and tools
- Third-party service webhooks
- Remote agent interaction via HTTP

## Technical Notes

- The endpoint runs on port 8001 (main agent server)
- Requires the agent server to be running (`poe serve-persag`)
- Uses the same agent instance as the Streamlit interface
- Supports all agent capabilities (memory, knowledge, tools, etc.)
- Response times depend on query complexity and tool usage

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future consideration:
- Streaming response support for long-running queries
- WebSocket endpoint for real-time bidirectional communication
- Authentication/authorization for remote access
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- Conversation history/context management
- Multi-turn conversation support with session IDs
