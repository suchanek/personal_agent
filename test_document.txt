This is a simple test document to verify that the LightRAG embedding dimension fix is working correctly.

The issue was that qwen3-embedding:4b produces 2560-dimensional embeddings, but the configuration was set to 768 dimensions.

This mismatch caused numpy vstack errors when trying to combine embeddings of different dimensions in the vector database.

Now that all configurations have been updated to use 2560 dimensions, document ingestion should work properly.
