fix: normalize natural language directory references in filesystem tools

Fixed critical bug where natural language directory references like "current
directory" were interpreted literally as directory names instead of path
shortcuts. When asked to save a file to "current directory", the system
would create a directory named "current directory/" instead of using the
actual current working directory.

Changes:
- Added natural language normalization to PersonalAgentFilesystemTools
- Added normalization to MCP-based filesystem tools
- Normalize "current directory"/"here"/"this directory" → "."
- Normalize "home"/"home directory" → "~"
- Fixed type hint: variable_to_return: str | None = None
- Added comprehensive test suite with 19 test classes
- Created ADR-101 documenting multi-user directory architecture
- Added FILESYSTEM_TOOLS_FIX.md technical summary

Files modified:
- src/personal_agent/tools/personal_agent_tools.py (lines 280, 294-300)
- src/personal_agent/tools/filesystem.py (lines 352-365)
- tests/core/test_filesystem_tools_normalization.py (new, comprehensive)
- tests/tools/test_personal_agent_tools.py (new, general coverage)
- refs/adr/101-user-home-directory-normalization.md (new)
- FILESYSTEM_TOOLS_FIX.md (new)
- CHANGELOG.md (v0.8.79.dev entry)

This fix ensures filesystem tools correctly interpret natural language
directory references, preventing accidental literal directory creation
and improving user experience with file operations.
